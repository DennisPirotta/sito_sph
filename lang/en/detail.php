This approach focuses on end-to-end communication of all physical resources and integration into digital ecosystems with the value of supply chain partners.<hr>In the context of Industry 4.0, services such as real-time data collection and monitoring, traceability, and paperless production are provided. Real-time data collection and monitoring help to provide realistic production planning and reduce costs, while traceability ensures product quality by monitoring raw materials and work-in-progress along the production line and supply chain. Paperless production, on the other hand, automates responses to challenges and decisions, by digitizing operations and integrating the workshop with real-time business creation."
